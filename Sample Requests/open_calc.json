      "Explanation",
      "-----------",
      "",
      "1.  **Modularity**: The calculator function is now self-contained and doesn't pollute the global namespace with unnecessary imports.",
      "2.  **Error Handling**: We've added a try-except block to catch any `OSError` exceptions that may occur when attempting to open the calculator. This provides a more robust and user-friendly experience.",
      "3.  **Proper Imports**: Instead of using `os.system`, which is generally discouraged due to security concerns and lack of flexibility, we've opted for the `subprocess` module, which provides a more modern and secure way to interact with the system.",
      "4.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The function now supports macOS and Linux, in addition to Windows. It uses the `sys.platform` variable to determine the current operating system and opens the corresponding calculator application.",
      "5.  **Documentation**: The function includes a docstring that describes its purpose, raises an exception, and provides example usage. This makes the code more readable, maintainable, and user-friendly."
